This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android SDK is not found or not configured correctly, even though the SDK is installed and properly configured. This is an uncommon error because the Expo CLI usually handles SDK detection and configuration automatically.  The specific error message can vary, but often involves a path to an SDK location that doesn't exist.
